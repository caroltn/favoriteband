    <h5 class="card-title">Fancy</h5>
    <p class="card-text">While keeping the group's previous quirky festive tone that has defined a majority of its hits, "Fancy" blends mellow mood pop electro beats with the members’ sophisticated, strong melodies. Singing about love, the bandmates boldly express their emotions with lines like "I won’t ever let you go" and "It doesn’t matter who liked who first".

      <p class="card-text">The lyrics of the song, which were written by Park Jin Young, was based on a conversation he had with members of Twice during dinner, in which they expressed the emotions they felt while dealing with the pressures of fame throughout the four years since their debut in 2015. "He expressed that into the lyrics," Nayeon explained. "This title track has our stories."

      <p class="card-text">"I Can't Stop Me" has been described as an '80s synthwave and pop song, with elements of disco. It is the group's first attempt at the retro-synth genre that has inspired the musical direction of their entire album. The song draws from European electronic and American synth-pop sound, supported by an arrangement of drum machines, "intoxicating" Latin beats, and "strong" instrumental sound. Lyrically, "I Can't Stop Me" talks about the conflict and duality of the good and bad of uncontrollable desires.
